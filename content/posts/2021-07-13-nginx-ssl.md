## 概述
An HTTPS connection involves two parties: the client (the one who is initiating the connection, usually your web browser), and the server. These two parties are the ones that ‘shake hands.’ The purpose of the SSL/TLS handshake is to perform all the cryptographic work needed to have a secure connection. This includes authenticating the SSL certificate being used, and generating an encryption key.

the __TLS handshake__ accomplishes 3 main things:
1. Exchanging cipher suites and parameters
2. Authenticating one or both parties
3. Creating/Exchanging symmetric session keys


## Why need it

## How it work

### Negotiating Cipher Suites

### Authentication

### Key Exchange

The last part of the TLS handshake involves creating the “session key,” which is the key that will actually be used for secure communication.

我们以`ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256`来做示例说明，

| 字段名      | 字段说明 |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| ECDHE      | __Key Exchange:__ Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman Ephemeral (ECDHE)       |
| ECDSA   | __Authentication:__ Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA)        |
| AES128-GCM | __Encryption:__ Advanced Encryption Standard with 128bit key in Galois/Counter mode (AES 128 GCM) |
| SHA256 | __Hash:__ Secure Hash Algorithm 256 (SHA256)|
